GUI assigner
===

This is a more advanced example of how to use the (Re)DNATCO nucleic acid processing library. The example is a fully functional GUI application that performs interactive NtC assigment. The example demonstrates the use of the C++ API wrapper.

Requirements
---

This example uses Qt 6 to create the GUI. To build this example, Qt 6 development environment must be available on your machine.

Usage
---

The example needs to be pointed to a directory with NtC classification parameters. Setting the "Path parameter directory" to the "assets" directory if this repository is sufficient.

Note that the example can only process mmCIF files.
